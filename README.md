# About Me

My name is Xulin Zhou（周旭林）, an undergraduate student at [Jinan University(JNU)](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) majoring in *Intelligence Science and Technology*. I am to study for a master's degree at [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS)](http://www.is.cas.cn/) in September 2023. 

**My interest lies in Computer Architecture and Deep Learning**. I was a participant of [OSPP Summer 2022](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/2022/#/homepage) and developer of [MindSpore community](https://www.mindspore.cn/), focusing on optimization at the compiler level in the deep learning framework. Now I am an intern at [PLCT lab](https://github.com/plctlab/PLCT-Weekly) and contribute to the MLIR-based project [Buddy Compiler](https://github.com/buddy-compiler/buddy-mlir). During my internship, I am working on deep learning model inference optimization based on RISC-V Vector Extension(which I have created a [web page](https://rvv-isadoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for referencing) and acting as a mentor of [OSPP Summer 2023](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/org/prodetail/238d90441).

# Fun Stuffs

In my spare time, I wrote [several columns](/blogs/main.md) to summarize thinking patterns and miscellaneous insights from my experiences and reading. Writing can help me better condense my thoughts and express myself. Currently, I am particularly interested in music and photography.

**I love music**. Since I usually glue to the computer screen for work, music is the spice of my life. The motivation to dive into music comes from the enthusiasm for pursuing a rich listening experience, just like the desire to travel to different cities and encounter exotic customs. Instead of being content with melodious songs, I will actively expose myself to various styles of music, whether classical or modern, in order to explore a more sophisticated *musical aesthetic*. I am also keen on music theory and learning [transcription of my favorate songs](https://www.mubucm.com/doc/6rwIq_gvp2m).

**I love photography**. Like many others, I take lots of photos when I travel, but I see photographs more as works of art conveying ideas rather than as mere visual mediums carrying facts. In addition to the commemorative function which makes photographs popular on social media, I am more interested in the *cultural implications* contained in a photograph itself. For example, I will pay more attention to laborers, regardless of their appearances or occupations, and hope to draw more attention to them through [my street photography works](/photography/main.md).
