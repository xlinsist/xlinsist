# About Me

My name is Xulin Zhou(周旭林), a first year postgraduate student at [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS)](http://www.is.cas.cn/) in Beijing. I graduated from [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm)  with a bachelor's degree in 2023. I was born and bred in Dongguan.

**My research interests lie in *Computer Architecture and Compiler Infrastructure*.** I am a member of [PLCT lab](https://github.com/plctlab/PLCT-Weekly) and contribute to [Buddy Compiler](https://buddy-compiler.github.io/). Now I am working on compiler optimization based on RISC-V instruction set.

**Writing is my long-standing habit.** I have been keeping a diary since high school. Parts of the diaries are organized as [several columns](/blogs/main.md) to summarize thinking patterns and miscellaneous insights from my experiences and reading. Living in the city, I enjoy taking photos to record urban life and culture, and organize them into [street photography works](/photography/main.md). When I am outdoors, I find great joy in experiencing different life styles and discovering a world of different dimensions.
