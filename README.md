# About Me

My name is Xulin Zhou（周旭林）, a first year postgraduate student at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). I graduated from [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm) with a bachelor's degree in 2023. I was born and bred in Dongguan, Guangdong, but I like "Autumn in Peiping" the most.

**My research interests lie in *Computer Architecture and Compiler Infrastructure*.** 
I have been contributing to the open-source community as a participant in [OSPP Summer 2022](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/2022/#/homepage) and as a mentor in [OSPP Summer 2023](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/). 
My contributions began during my internship at Huawei, where I focused on static graph compilation in the deep learning framework [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/). After that I worked as an intern at [PLCT lab](https://github.com/plctlab/PLCT-Weekly) and contributed to the MLIR-based project [Buddy Compiler](https://github.com/buddy-compiler/buddy-mlir). 
Now I am working on compilation optimization based on RISC-V instruction set at [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS)](http://www.is.cas.cn/).

 **Writing is my long-standing habit.** I have been keeping a diary since high school. Parts of the diaries are organized as [several columns](/blogs/main.md) to summarize thinking patterns and miscellaneous insights from my experiences and reading. Additionally, I enjoy taking many photos during my travels and organizing them into [street photography works](/photography/main.md) to document my life.
