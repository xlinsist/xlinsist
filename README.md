# One Page About Me {docsify-ignore}

My name is Xulin Zhou（周旭林）, an undergraduate student at [Jinan University(JNU)](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) majoring in *Intelligence Science and Technology*. I am to study for a master's degree at [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS)](http://www.is.cas.cn/) in September 2023. 

My interest lies in *Computer Architecture and Machine Learning*. I was the participant of [OSPP Summer 2022](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/#/homepage) and developer of [MindSpore community](https://www.mindspore.cn/), focusing on optimization at the compiler level in deep learning framework. Now I work as an intern in [PLCT lab](https://github.com/plctlab/PLCT-Weekly) and contribute to the MLIR-based project [Buddy Compiler](https://github.com/buddy-compiler/buddy-mlir).

In my spare time, I wrote [several columns](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1499075816512790528) to summarize miscellaneous insights and thought patterns during my experiences and reading periods. I am also trying to seize reminiscence by [street photography](/photography/main.md). Besides that, I am keen on music theory and learning [transcription of my favorate songs](https://www.mubucm.com/doc/6rwIq_gvp2m). In the outdoors, I play street workout and join the shuttlecock school team.
